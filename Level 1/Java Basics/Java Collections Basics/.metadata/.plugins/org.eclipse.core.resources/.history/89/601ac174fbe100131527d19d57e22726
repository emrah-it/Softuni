//Problem 12.	Cards Frequencies
//We are given a sequence of N playing cards from a standard deck. The input 
//consists of several cards (face + suit), separated by a space. 
//Write a program to calculate and print at the console the frequency 
//of each card face in format "card_face -> frequency". The 
//frequency is calculated by the formula appearances / N and is 
//expressed in percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal 
//point. The card faces with their frequency should be printed in the 
//order of the card face's first appearance in the input. The same card 
//can appear multiple times in the input, but it's face should be listed only once in the output.
